      "response": "Based on your stress levels, I recommend trying a 5-minute breathing exercise. Inhale deeply for 4 counts, hold for 2, then exhale for 6. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system. With your history of meditation practice, you might also benefit from a short guided meditation focused on stress relief."

      "type": "low_energy",
      "response": "I see from your health data that you typically experience energy dips around this time. Since you're focusing on nutrition improvements, try a small protein-rich snack with complex carbs - perhaps a Greek yogurt with berries and a sprinkle of granola. Your records show this combination has worked well for your energy levels previously."
